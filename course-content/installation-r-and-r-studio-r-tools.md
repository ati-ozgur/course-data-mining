# Installing R, RTools and RStudio

- [Installing R](https://cran.uni-muenster.de/)
	

- Installing RTools (Windows)

	If we are using only well known packages, we do not need to install RTools since most of the well known packages has binary packages on the CRAN. 
	But some packages needs to be compiled and these compiler tools does not exists in windows most of the time.
	To be able to use this packages, we need to install RTools on windows only.

	- See [official documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)

- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

	RStudio is the integrated development environment (IDE) for R. 
	We will use it most of the time.
