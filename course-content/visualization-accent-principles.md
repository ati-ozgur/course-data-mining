# ACCENT Principles for effective graphical display

Summarized from [here](https://www.datavis.ca/gallery/accent.php) by Michael Friendly


Graphics are used for communication. The following ACCENT principles determine if the effectiveness of your figure.


Apprehension
	Could you understand relationships between variables?

Clarity:
	Could you distinguish all elements in graph?

Consistency:
	Are the colors, shapes etc are consistent in your document.
	This is especially important if you use different programs for figure creation.

Efficiency:
	Is your graph simple, easy to interpret?
Necessity:
	Do you need a graph for this purpose? May be a table or text would be better alternative?
	Or you could change graph type.

Truthfulness:
	Do your graph shows true values according to their magnitude.
	Scales are very important here.
	3D pie charts especially violate this principle
