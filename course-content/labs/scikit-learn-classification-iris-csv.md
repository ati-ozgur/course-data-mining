# Simple classification example on iris dataset using weka

1. [install python and conda](../installation-python-conda.md) on your computer

2. Read [iris dataset](iris.md) page.

3. run following python file in the command line

[classification_iris_full_data_csv.py](classification_iris_full_data_csv.py)

Here, we load iris dataset from a csv file


4. Different from the first python run, we are splitting our dataset to train and test in this example.
We should never report the results on training data set as in our [first example](classification_iris_full_data_csv.py).
We should always have a separate test dataset.
